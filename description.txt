An essential mod - Ancient Cards Mod - adds in an entirely new 'accesory' system with its own slot. Every monster has a chance to drop their own designated card. Each enemy's card will provide it's beholder with cool and unique effects. However, only 1 card can be equipped at a time. This means cards have a synergistic effect with accesories, but they can't have synergy with other cards. That makes them each balanced. Instead of drastically changing how you play Terraria, these cards add a new collectable aspect and another reason to grind up those monsters!
